This is a capstone project of microverse redux-react module. This is a catalogue for tv shows that displays information about a particular show. User can search for their favourite tv by using the search input option. This single page application displays list of popular shows with thumbnail images. User can see more information about their favourite show by clicking on the show info button. Individual page of the show provides overview of the show, summary, schedule time and date, it's current status etc. This application uses redux to store data and to serve data. React-router was used to define several links which makes the app useful.
